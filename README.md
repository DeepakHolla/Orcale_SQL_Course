ORACLE SQL SINGLE TABLE QUERIES


Server used: Oracle Application Express (APEX)
Client used: Oracle Application Express (APEX)
Database used: The generic EMP Table (Employee Table) and DEPT Table (Department Table) from the Sample Datasets using the 
SQL Workshop > Utilities > Sample Datasets

The Situation: We need to retrieve the requested data making use of the SELECT clause. 

The Objective: Use APEX to:
Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from the EMP & DEPT tables to answer all questions being asked my management. Each question will require you to write a SQL query along with a FROM clause (maybe along with a WHERE clause based on the requested data).
